# Scraping-Youtube-Data-Using-Youtube-Data-API
This project is about to build a Python Project to Scrape YouTube data using YouTube Data API. Using YouTube API, data is being extracted and then load this data into a Python Pandas DataFrame and then analyze this data. Finally, built a simple visualization from this data using the Python Seaborn library.

It involves following steps;
1. Creating a Youtube API key 
2. Using API key to access data from multiple youtube channels
3. Creation of virtual environment by using anaconda
4. Installation of required python packages (i.e google API python client - which is required to access youtube API data, Pandas, Seaborn)
5. Loading extraced data from multiple youtube channels (no. of subscribers, channel name, views, no. of videos etc) into pandas dataframe
6. Visualization of data for comparison by using seaborn library
